I'm Vaibhav Yenamandra and this is my static blog. 
I'm a Comptuer Science Masters student at the University of Florida studying machine learning, data-mining and related topics.
Normally I'd add a re-assuring picture to convince you I am not an AI, but I don't have one right now, so you'll have to take my word for it.

This site is primarily a collection of essays that I write about topics so that I can refer to them later conveniently. I tend to forget about stuff if I'm not involved for a good length of time.

Sometimes I'll just link to another blog with short commentary if I feel that they've really given me insight about an area. My areas of interest are: Theoretical CS, Semi-supervised / Unsupervised Machine Learning applied to Computer Vision
