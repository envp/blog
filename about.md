I'm Vaibhav Yenamandra and this is my static blog. 
I'm a Comptuer Science Master student at UF studying machine learning, data-mining and related topics. 
Normally I'd add a re-assuring picture to convince you I am not an AI, but I don't have one right now, so you'll have to take my word for it.

This site is primarily a collection of essays that I write when I feel I've gained more insight into a specific area so that I can refer to them later conveniently.

Sometimes I'll just link to another blog with short commentary if I feel that they've really opened my eyes about an area. My areas of interest are: Theoretical CS, Semi / Unsupervised Machine Learning applied to Computer Vision
